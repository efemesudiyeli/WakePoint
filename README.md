# üó∫Ô∏è WakePoint

**WakePoint** is a personal iOS project built with SwiftUI and MapKit that notifies users when they get close to a selected destination on the map. It is designed to demonstrate my SwiftUI skills and practical use of Apple's location APIs.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an open-source project, but I do **not accept contributions**. The project is intended to showcase my work and serve as part of my developer portfolio.
